# Density-based-traffic-control-system

Used coco dataset and detecting vehicles from streaming video. After detection it is classified as car ,truck ,etc.Counting the vehicles and accordingly switching the traffic lights.
Traffic is classified as heavy, moderate or low- so different time slots are given for each type. Code is written in Python. 
I also presented a working model for this, Arduino was used as a microcontroller.
